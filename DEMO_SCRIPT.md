### 5. Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes)

**Say:**
> "Let me explain the technology behind this."

**Click on "How It Works" accordion:**

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
**Say:**
> "The system uses a 7-step preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, and stop word removal to clean and prepare the text."

#### 2. Feature Extraction
**Say:**
> "I implemented a hybrid approach combining TF-IDF for statistical importance and Word2Vec with GloVe embeddings for semantic understanding. This creates a 5,100-dimensional feature space."

**Highlight:**
- TF-IDF captures word importance
- Word2Vec understands semantic meaning
- Hybrid approach is more accurate than either alone

#### 3. Classification
**Say:**
> "The system uses ensemble learning - three different machine learning models voting together: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression."

#### 4. Training Data
**Say:**
> "The model is trained on over 50,000 labeled articles from four major datasets: Kaggle, McIntire, BuzzFeed, and Reuters."

Recall:    92.80%
F1-Score:  93.00%
```

**Explain:**
- "These metrics rival commercial solutions"
- "The ensemble approach provides reliability"
- "Confusion matrix shows balanced performance"

## üí° Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Q: "How accurate is it?"
**A:** "94-96% accuracy on test data, which is competitive with commercial solutions. The ensemble approach with three models provides robust predictions."

### Q: "What data did you train it on?"
**A:** "50,000+ labeled articles from four reputable sources: Kaggle, McIntire, BuzzFeed, and Reuters, covering various news categories and time periods."

### Q: "How fast is the analysis?"
**A:** "Real-time - typically 2-3 seconds for analysis, including preprocessing and classification."

### Q: "Can it detect satire?"
